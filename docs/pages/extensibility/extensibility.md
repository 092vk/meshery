Meshery has an extensible architecture with several extension points. Meshery provides several extension points for working with different service meshes via [adapters](#adapters), different [load generators](#load-generators) and different [providers](#providers). Meshery also offers a REST API.

**Guiding Principles for Extensibility**

The following principles are upheld in the design of Meshery's extensibility.

1. Recognize that different deployment environments have different systems to integrate with.
1. Offer a default experience that provides the optimal user experience.

## Extension Points

Meshery is not just an application. It is a set of microservices where the central component is itself called Meshery. Integrators may extend Meshery by taking advantage of designated Extension Points. Extension points come in various forms and are available through Mesheryâ€™s architecture.

The following points of extension are currently incorporated into Meshery.

**Types of Extension Points:**

1. [Providers]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/providers)
1. [Load Generators]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/load-generators)
1. [Adapters]({{site.baseurl}}/extensibility/adapters)
1. [REST API](#rest-api)

## REST API
Meshery provides a REST API available through the default port of `9081/tcp`.

### Authentication
Requests to any of the API endpoints must be authenticated and include a valid JWT access token in the HTTP headers. Type of authentication is determined by the selected [Provider](#providers). Use of the Local Provider, "None", puts Meshery into single-user mode and does not require authentication.

### Authorization
Currently, Meshery only requires a valid token in order to allow clients to invoke its APIs.

### Endpoints
Each of the API endpoints are exposed through [server.go](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/blob/master/router/server.go). Endpoints are grouped by function (e.g. /api/mesh or /api/perf).
