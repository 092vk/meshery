layer5_integration_pages: Kanister is a framework that enables application-level data management on Kubernetes. It allows domain experts to capture application specific data management tasks via blueprints, which can be easily shared and extended. The framework takes care of the tedious details surrounding execution on Kubernetes and presents a homogeneous operational experience across applications at scale.
: Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kanister Operator
: 
: <p>,     Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology., </p>, <p>,     Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs., </p>
: Encapsulate key data management tasks in blueprints that allow uniform operations at scale.
legend:: Customize blueprints to fit specific needs of your environment and workload without starting from scratch.
yellow_background__=_custom_text;_do_not_overwrite_with_formula
red_background_=_data_is_mising
blue_background_=_model_entry_(not_a_component): Keep application images unchanged by including required tools as a sidecar container or as a separate pod.
: Collaborative Infrastructure as Code
: Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
