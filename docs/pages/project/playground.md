## Why do I need to sign-up/register to use the Cloud Native Playground?

The Playground is connected to live Kubernetes clusters, and while these clusters are refreshed on a daily basis, the clusters do need to be protected from nefarious actors, who might use these clusters for cryptomining, for example.

Sign-up to receive a user account, entitled with perpetually free and full access the Playground environment.

The Meshery Playground is connected to live Kubernetes cluster(s) and allows users full-control over those clusters. Requiring users to register a user account keeps the Playground safe and healthy for all to enjoy. Without requiring users to sign-in, the Meshery Playground would allow anonymous access for anyone and everyone to potentially perform nefarious acts.

## Will I lose my Meshery designs in the Cloud Native Playground?
No, all of the designs that you have created in the Meshery Playground are saved to your user account and will be available to you each time that you sign into your account. Your designs will be available in the Meshery Playground and any your other Meshery deployments, too.

In other words, all work done in MeshMap Designer is persisted to your user account.

## Will I lose my Meshery deployments in the Cloud Native Playground?
Yes, the Meshery Playground clusters are reset on a daily basis. However, only deployments (not designs) that you may have created will be lost.

In other words, only MeshMap Visualizer is reset. All of your work in Meshery UI and MeshMap Designer will remain in your user account.
