# Layer5

The Meshery project is maintained by Layer5 community. We are an open source organisation governed by [CNCF's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward.

#### [**Community First**](https://layer5.io/community)

<p>The <a href="https://layer5.io">Layer5</a> community represents the largest collection of service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world.</p>
The Meshery project is community-built and welcomes collaboration!
