### [v0.3.5](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/tag/v0.3.5)

**What's new ?**

- Mesheryctl
  - Removal of `init` as a command exposed to users. This command's functionality is used internal to `mesheryctl start`. A new `start --check` command will provide preflight check functionality in `init`'s place.
