<h2>What are Meshery Models?</h2>

<p>Meshery Models are foundational components within Meshery, a cloud-native management plane that facilitates the management of multi-cloud and cloud-native applications and infrastructure. Meshery Models define a structured set of entities that Meshery can manage, offering a standardized way to represent and interact with cloud-native resources.<br>

    Each Meshery Model is based on a <a href="https://github.com/meshery/schemas/blob/master/openapi/schemas/meshmodels.yml">Model schema</a> with well-defined attributes. This allows Meshery to maintain a consistent and extensible approach to representing infrastructure components and their relationships. Meshery Models can encompass simple applications, complex microservices architectures, and even infrastructure platforms like Istio or Nighthawk.<br>
    
    To effectively manage these resources, each model is supported by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/concepts/logical/registry">registrants</a>, which are responsible for configuring specific infrastructure platforms, whether cloud-based or self-hosted. Registrants vary in their capabilities, offering everything from infrastructure-specific orchestration to additional functionality that extends Meshery's features.</p>
