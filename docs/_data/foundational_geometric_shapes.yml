- Shape: Circle
  Description: The default shape for nodes, displayed as an oval. This shape is useful for general-purpose nodes where no special distinction is required.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Representing entities in entity-relationship diagrams
    - Highlighting key concepts in mind maps
    - Nodes in flowcharts
  DependOn: Often used to differentiate from standard circular nodes.

- Shape: Generic Node
  Description: A simple, often circular or rectangular shape used as a placeholder
    for unspecified or generic data points.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Representing undefined or flexible entities in early-stage diagrams
    - Showing placeholder nodes in template diagrams
    - Indicating generic components in adaptable system designs
  DependOn: Can be connected to various other node types, often used as a base
    for more specific node definitions

- Shape: Polygon
  Description: A custom point polygon allows the creation of irregular, user-defined polygonal shapes for graph nodes.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Representing complex entities or structures in data visualization that standard shapes cannot depict.
    - Depicting specialized components in system architecture diagrams with non-standard shapes.

- Shape: Plus(Polygon)
  Description: A polygonal shape with any number of points, allowing for highly customizable node representations to fit specific data needs.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Customizable nodes for specific diagram requirements
    - Representing complex entities with varying numbers of attributes or connections
    - Creating unique shapes for specialized domain visualizations
  DependOn: The number of points often corresponds to the number of attributes, connections, or steps in the represented concept

- Shape: Round Rectangle
  Description: Similar to a rectangle but with rounded corners, providing a softer, more approachable look. This shape is often used to visually distinguish nodes from standard rectangular nodes, indicating a special status or different type of data.
  CommonUsecase:
    - Softening the appearance of process steps
    - Representing user interface elements
    - Indicating start/end points in flowcharts
  DependOn: Similar to rectangles but often used for a more aesthetic or user-friendly appearance.

- Shape: Triangle
  Description: A simple three-sided shape, often used to represent hierarchical data or directional flows. It is useful for indicating movement, direction, or hierarchical relationships within a network.
  CommonUsecase: 
    - Representing directional flow or hierarchy
    - Indicating warning or caution points in a process
    - Denoting transformation or conversion steps
  DependOn: Often used in conjunction with other shapes to show direction or change.
