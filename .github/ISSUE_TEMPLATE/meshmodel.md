#### Instructions for Defining a new Relationship
1. Identify the relationship and any specific constraints to be enforced between the two specific components, their models or potentially other components, models, or environmental considerations.
2. Propose a specific visual representation for the relationship. Review and familiarize with the available set of predefined relationship types. Refer the cytoscape [style guide](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style). Virtual representation for existing context-aware designs.

iii. [Binding](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/assets/images/binding_realtionship.png)
3. Prospose the appropriate relationship type, using one of the predefined set of relationship types or suggest a new relationship where an existing type does not fit.
4. Create a Relationship Definition (yaml). See the [Relationship Schema](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/server/meshmodel/schemas) in MeshModel and [examples]([url](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/tree/master/server/meshmodel/relationships)).
5. Create a policy for evaluation of the relationship (rego). See examples.
