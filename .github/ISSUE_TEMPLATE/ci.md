### Test Plan Sheet Contributing Guidelines:

- Adding New Rows:
  - Create a new row in the v0.7.0 sheet when a new test scenario is implemented.The test scenario should
    include the combination of Test Group, Component Under Test, Platform, Service Mesh, Action, and Expected Outcome.
- Updating Existing Rows:
  - Modify an existing row in the v0.7.0 sheet if a test scenario has modified.
  - Update should be based on the user's experience with a recent release or when building from source and should include the relevant fields in existing rows.
