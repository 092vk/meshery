Created aws-ec2-controller model at some_custom_dir/subdir/one_more_subdir/aws-ec2-controller

Next steps:
1. cd some_custom_dir/subdir/one_more_subdir/aws-ec2-controller
2. Edit model.json to customize your model configuration
3. Add your components in the components/ directory
4. Define relationships in relationships/ directory
5. Add your connections in the connections/ directory
6. Define credentials in credentials/ directory
7. Use 'mesheryctl model build' to package your model

To import this model into Meshery:
$ mesheryctl model import some_custom_dir/subdir/one_more_subdir/aws-ec2-controller

To export this model as OCI image:
$ mesheryctl model build some_custom_dir/subdir/one_more_subdir/aws-ec2-controller/v1.2.3 -t myregistry/aws-ec2-controller:v1.2.3
